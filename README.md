# ServantApp | https://servantapp.herokuapp.com/

You will need the .env file for this project in order for it to run. Should be stickied in the **dev-lounge** channel on discord, but feel free to DM me if you need it.

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run: 

### `npm install`

**No need to switch directories and run it again.** It's configured to install both server and client dependencies. 

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in developer mode. Best for making quick changes and seeing the results live. **Use this instead of npm start.**

### `npm run prod`

Runs the current production build. **Does not automatically show changes like dev.**

### `npm run build`

Compiles the current developer build and prepares it to be used in production. **Heroku does this automatically.**
